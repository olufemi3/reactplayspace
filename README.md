# reactplayspace
A playspace for me as I start learning React.js

This will also be a sort of Diary, documenting my journey

## May 12, 2023
I deployed my first React Application on my website https://lufemi.com. 
It felt good to be able to do so after researching a bit.
And now I've decided to write a tutorial about it. The tutorial is more for myself in case I need to do this process again in the future. But it's also a good way to practice writing blogs and documentation. 

Here we go la!
